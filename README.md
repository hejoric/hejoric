I'm a Computer Science student at UVA with a passion for creating impactful software solutions. While earning my associate's degree, I worked as a server and at Costco to support my education and pursue my dreams. I'm located in Northern Virginia.

I’m particularly interested in developing retail software, video game development, and language learning applications. My experiences have shaped my resilience, adaptability, and work ethic, which I bring into every project I tackle.

Outside of coding, I enjoy learning new languages, playing music, working out, and exploring video games. I’m always eager to connect with like-minded individuals and collaborate on innovative ideas.
